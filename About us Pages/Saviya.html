                        </div>

                        <p class="type-2">This service aims to enhance the livelihoods of small-scale dairy farmers by
                            improving their production capacity, quality of milk produced and health of livestock. The
                            service is provided in partnership with the International Executive Service Corps (IESC) who
                            aims to advance sustainable growth in Sri Lanka’s dairy sector by supporting farmers and
                            related enterprises through the Market Oriented Dairy (MOD) Project funded by the United
                            States Department of Agriculture (USDA) ‘Food for Progress’ initiative. The knowledge
                            service’s content is provided by the subject-matter experts of the MOD Project and reviewed
                            by the Department of Animal Health and Production (DAPH) of Sri Lanka.</p>

                        <p class="type-2">Dairy is the most important sub-sector in the Sri Lankan livestock industry,
                            yet currently the country can meet only about 30 to 40 percent of fresh milk demand locally.
                            While Sri Lanka is largely self-sufficient in terms of most animal products, it is
                            increasingly dependent on international suppliers to meet the growing demand for dairy
                            products by local consumers. While the MOD Project is aiming to enhance the capacities of
                            over 5,000 dairy farmers to improve the quantity and quality of locally produced milk, the
                            lack of access to relevant information continues to be a prominent issue affecting over
                            332,335 of Sri Lanka’s dairy farmers. Saviya addresses this information gap by providing
                            accurate and relevant dairy information on best practices, dairy management, cattle feeding
                            and calf management which are then sent straight to the farmer’s mobile phone and customized
                            according to their individual requirements, animal’s development stages with access to other
                            relevant information such as good nutrition and disease prevention. This service supports
                            the existing extension efforts by DAPH, Provincial DAPHs and Dairy Processing Companies, by
                            enabling a broader reach by providing registered dairy entrepreneurs and farmers with time
                            bound technical messages linked to the lactation cycle of animals from pregnancy to calving.
