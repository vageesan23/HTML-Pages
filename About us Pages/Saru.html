                        <p class="type-2">Accelerating Sri Lankan agriculture and enhancing crop quality through
                            affordable protected and automated agriculture kits, Saru, is a project by Dialog Axiata PLC
                            conducted in collaboration with University of Moratuwa and University of Ruhuna.</p>

                        <p class="type-2">Smallholder agriculture dominates rural Sri Lanka, home to 80% of the
                            population. Agriculture employs 33% of the workforce and utilizes 44% of the land, yet
                            contributes only 9% to GDP. Being unable to invest qualitatively or quantitatively in
                            improving their production, low income smallholders find it complex to adapt to unfamiliar
                            new technologies ultimately yielding low productivity and low returns. Research shows that
                            the Sri Lankan agriculture sector is less efficient when compared with other countries.</p>

                        <p class="type-2">Sri Lanka faces a food crisis due to the rapid ageing of the farming
                            population, unattractiveness of the farming career to the youth, conversion of fertile land
                            to non-agricultural uses, water depletion and land degradation, harvest losses due to
                            increasingly adverse climatic phenomena, compounding pest and disease damage, high
                            fluctuations in prices and crop diversification issues. Developed countries face similar
                            issues and, their extensive research and development helps them overcome those challenges
                            while better managing their food security.</p>

                        <p class="type-2">One of the more promising solutions is affordable, climate-smart and protects
                            agriculture by liberating smallholders from the tyranny of the weather and seasonal changes.
                            Research shows a potential 50% - 300% yield increase through environment-controlled
                            agriculture. Under the current partnership with the University of Ruhuna, Dialog is building
                            a knowledge base of crop management parameters required for protected agriculture in such
                            conditions as well as conducting field testing to test the data in field conditions. Low
                            cost sensors and actuator nodes are developed through a partnership with University of
                            Moratuwa.</p>

                        <p class="type-2">IoT (Internet of Things) connects sensors and actuators while remotely
                            controlling and monitoring the activities, with a monitoring panel accessible via smart
                            phones. Further, agriculture know-how for regular operation (i.e. fertilizer application,
                            water management, assessing growth and pest and disease identification) will be available at
                            the farmerâ€™s fingertips using mobile technology. Being cloud-connected, real-time roll-outs
                            of rapid updates or interventions to respond to short-term phenomena in agricultural
                            operations will potentially have a national level significance.</p>
