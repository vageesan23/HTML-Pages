                                        the market place. We continue to work tirelessly, to make our services
                                        accessible, especially to rural populations, the elderly, low-income groups and
                                        the differently able; thereby empowering all Sri Lankans to reap the benefits of
                                        economic, educational, health and entertainment opportunities that result from

                                        affordability, applicability and affinity rank among the most pertinent. Through
                                        our sustainable business models we have addressed these issues through
                                        technology paradigms, service and business modeling and continuous investments.

                                        incorporate state of the art technology capabilities to deliver local

                                        This pioneered the usage of electronic recharge (top-up) technology in Sri
                                        Lanka. The obliteration of the paper-based voucher increased distribution
                                        efficiencies and reduced the “minimum recharge” constraints on consumers, which
                                        further reduced spend commitments while also encouraging adoption of mobile
                                        telephony services across the mass market.</p>

                                    <p><b>CASE:</b> Dialog Mobile – eZ Buddy<br />
                                        This ‘Shared Access to Voice’ concept refers to the sharing of a mobile phone,
                                        as opposed to individual ownership, in the form of a supervised public phone.
                                        This innovation helps deliver telecom services to rural communities beyond the
                                        conventional paradigm, increasing availability.</p>

                                    <p><b>CASE:</b> Enabling Sinhala and Tamil Language (Local Language) Services<br />
                                        Sinhala / Tamil SMS on 2G Handsets facilitates local communities to make full
                                        use of mobile technology. Those who previously restricted use to voice calls
                                        were thereby empowered to use text messaging for correspondence, allowing them
                                        greater flexibility to communicate. The Sinhala/Tamil Portal for Mobile
                                        Information and Entertainment helps those using only local language the option
                                        of accessing information in their language of choice.</p>

                                    <p><b>CASE:</b> Dialog Mobile – Star Call<br />
                                        This is a facility where another user in the same network can leave a voice
                                        message, allowing users who are not confident in using a mobile phone for text
                                        messaging an alternative option. It also promoted more responsible mobile use by
                                        giving consumers an alternative to text messaging.</p>

                                        Through technological innovations such as these, Dialog hopes to make products

                                        Dialog’s state of the art Customer Contact Centre is billed as Sri Lanka’s
                                        largest and most modern Contact Management facility. Through delivering
                                        successive enhancements to its customer interaction capabilities, Dialog has
                                        been able to create a strong affinity to the brand in the heart &amp; mind of

                                        excellence in Customer Service and Relationship Management Practices.</p>

                                    <p>In March of 2008 Dialog was again awarded three awards at the Greater China

                                    <p class="type-1"><b>Future Challenges &amp; Responses</b></p>

                                    <p>At present it is mainly the ‘cost of connectivity’ that is a considerable barrier
                                        for rural communities of Sri Lanka. This impediment is faced by all business
                                        units at Dialog across the board when striving to be more inclusive in its
                                        product and service offerings. Dialog constantly looks at introducing new price
                                        strategies to assist rural penetration.</p>

                                    <p>Lack of awareness among customers on how connectivity can benefit them or enhance
                                        their quality of life is another challenge common to business units. Dialog has
                                        identified the role that our retailer network and downstream supply chain can
                                        play in raising awareness on the benefits of being connected among those who are
                                        yet to avail our technology to their advantage. We will be looking at these
                                        channels to ‘spread the message’ to a greater extent in time to come.</p>

                                    <p>Dialog will continue to develop multiple penetration strategies in order to
                                        enhance the ‘connecting the unconnected’ drive in rural Sri Lanka.</p>
