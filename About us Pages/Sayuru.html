                                Warning Service for Day-boat Fishermen</b></p>

                        <p class="type-2">Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s premier connectivity provider, in 2020 launched
                            ‘Sayuru’ a free, trilingual fully-fledged SMS and voice messages-based weather and warning
                            service for day-boat fishermen, who generally have the lowest incomes in fisheries
                            communities. The service was developed with the close cooperation of the Department of
                            Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in partnership with the Department of Meteorology and is
                            provided free of charge as a national service.</p>

                        <p class="type-2">Unpredictable weather conditions have an adverse effect on livelihoods among
                            coastal communities, and day-boat fishermen have the most limited means to seek advanced
                            warning or receive emergency messages and return to safety. ‘Sayuru’ was developed to
                            minimize risks for such fishermen by providing a platform to receive accurate information
                            and alerts, instantly. The system is designed to provide location-based updates on weather
                            and other alerts to fishermen through SMS and voice messages. It provides on-time weather
                            forecasts to registered fishermen and is programmed to send emergency alerts (SMS and Voice)
                            for rapidly developing weather hazards.</p>
